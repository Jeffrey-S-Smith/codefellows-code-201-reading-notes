# CSS Forms and JS Events

## Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

    Forms remain one of the most important types of interactions for users on the web and in apps. In fact, forms are often considered the final step in the journey of completing their goals. Forms are just a means to an end. Users should be able to complete them quickly and without confusion.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

1. Order the Form Logically and Only Ask What’s Required
2. Present Fields in a Single Column Layout
3. Minimize the Number of Input Fields and User Typing Effort
4. Match Fields to the Size of the Input
5. Place Labels Above the Corresponding Input Felds
6. Use Forgiving Formatting
7. Don’t Use Placeholder Text as Input Field Label
8. Distinguish Optional And Required Fields
9. Avoid ‘Reset’ Button
10. Provide Highly Visible and Specific Error Messages

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
\<input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.
\<label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the \<label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
\<select> element defines a drop-down list:
\<textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area):
\<button> element defines a clickable button:

### Introduction To Events

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

    The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

    The target event property returns the element that triggered the event. The target property gets the element on which the event originally occurred, opposed to the currentTarget property, which always refers to the element whose event listener triggered the event.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM

while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM.
