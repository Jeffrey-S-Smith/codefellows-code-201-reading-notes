# Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Like so many technologies, the concept of video communication and video conferencing was way ahead of the technology of its day. Soon after the telephone was invented in the late 1800s people were dissatisfied with just hearing the other party -- they also wanted to see the other party.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the \<video> element.

The controls attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that video controls should be displayed.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the \<video> element?

Embedded content elements can have fallback content: content that is to be used when the external resource cannot be used (e.g. because it is of an unsupported format).

4. Write a very short story where \<audio> and \<video> are characters.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

Grid Container To make an HTML element behave as a grid container, you have to set the display property to grid or inline-grid . Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows.

grid item A grid container contains grid items. By default, a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.

grid line Alternatively referred to as a column separator or row separator, grid lines or gridlines divide each of the cells, rows, and columns in a spreadsheet. They are also frequently used in graphic design programs, such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, to help align elements in a document.

## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Images do not gracefully adapt to different screen sizes without some effort to get them to. Having responsive images is important because it helps us deliver optimal file size, the right image for the right screen size, improves user experience and improves loading time.

2. Define the following \<img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

srcset allows you to define a list of different image resources along with size information so that browser can pick the most appropriate image based on the actual device's resolution. The actual width of the image or display density: Either using display density descriptor, for example, 1.5x , 2x

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

Because you can offer multiple sizes of the same image, you can improve the loading time of your site. It's no longer needed to serve that big hero image on a small screen. With srcset and sizes you can offer a smaller size which will be used by the browser. This results in a faster website
