## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    Syntax errors: errors due to the fact that the syntax of the language is not respected. Semantic errors: errors due to an improper use of program statements.

    Logical errors: errors due to the fact that the specification is not respected.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    ReferenceError - This error is thrown when a reference made to a variable/item is broken. That is the variable/item doesn’t exist. When a variable is not defined

  SyntaxError - These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

  TypeError - occurs when an operation is performed on a wrong data type. Maybe a boolean is expected but a sting is found.

  if we try to convert a number to uppercase it will throw this error

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Debugging and errors will be there if you write code or someone else write code and cause issues that break the code and you need to fix the code.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

    In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

    Breakpoint definition A point of discontinuity, change, or cessation is a point in a program at which operation may be interrupted for debugging purposes or manual intervention. noun. A situation in tennis in which one more point is needed to break the opponent's serve.

3. What is the call stack?

     Call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.

## Questions or Comments (If no questions provided, summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience.)
This reading was about Debugging and troubleshooting errors in your code. which will be the longtime thing when you write code or you look at other peoples code.
