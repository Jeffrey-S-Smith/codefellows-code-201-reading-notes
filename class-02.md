# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module

This topic matters relates to what I am studying in this module is because I am beginning to use HTML, CSS and Javascript and you need to learn the basics of each language.

## Introduction to HTML

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There six levels of headings in HTML.

3. What are some uses for the \<sup> and \<sub> elements?

\<sup> element is a  HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

The <sup> element should only be used for typographical reasons—that is, to change the position of the text to comply with typographical conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or appearance purposes.

Appropriate use cases for <sup> include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

* Displaying exponents, such as "x 3 ." It may be worth considering the use of MathML for these, especially in more complex cases
* Displaying superior lettering, which is used in some languages when rendering certain abbreviations. For example, in French, the word "mademoiselle" can be abbreviated "M lle "); this is an acceptable use case.
* Representing ordinal numbers, such as "4 th " instead of "fourth."

\<sub> element is a HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.

The \<sub> element should be used only for typographical reasons—that is, to change the position of the text to comply with typographical conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or appearance purposes.

For example, using \<sub> to style the name of a company which uses altered baselines in their wordmark would not be appropriate; instead, CSS should be used (likely the vertical-align property, such as vertical-align: sub or, to more precisely control the baseline shift, vertical-align: -25%.

Appropriate use cases for \<sub> include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

* Marking up footnote numbers.

* Marking up the subscript in mathematical variable numbers (although you may also consider using a MathML formula for this).

* enoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula (such as every developer's best friend, C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 , otherwise known as "caffeine").

4. When using the \<abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

## Learn CSS

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

There are three ways to apply CSS to our HTML Inline, Internal and External.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

Inline styles, while they have a purpose, generally are not the best way to maintain your website. They go against every one of the best practices. Inline styles don't separate content from design: Inline styles are exactly the same as embedded font and other clunky design tags that modern developers rail against.

3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
    1. What is representing the selector?

    H2 is the selector.

    2. Which components are the CSS declarations?

    Declarations are color: black; and padding: 5px;

    3. Which components are considered properties?

      The properties are color:, padding

```
  h2 { 
     color: black; 
     padding: 5px;  
    }
```

## Learn JS

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

String Data Type

2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

-- Arithmetic Operators.
-- Comparison Operators.
-- Logical Operators.
-- Assignment Operators.

3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

The cost of living in the United States.

### Making Decisions In Your Code - Conditional

1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

true and true.

2. What is the use of an else if?

else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.

4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
