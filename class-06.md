# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

* How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

* What are some advantages to creating object literals?

* How do objects differ from arrays?

* Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an     object’s property instead of dot notation.

* Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

```js script
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```

## Introduction To The DOM

* What is the DOM?

* Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
