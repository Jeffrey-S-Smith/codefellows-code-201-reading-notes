## Local-Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

LocalStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

* Do not store sensitive user information in localStorage.
* It is not a substitute for a server based database as information is only stored on the browser.
* localStorage is limited to 5MB across all major browsers.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

localStorage is a way to store data on the client's computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5.
