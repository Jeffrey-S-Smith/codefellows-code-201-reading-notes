### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats

1.What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

2.How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

1.Add alt text and title if you want your images to be conveyed to all users.
2.If the picture is purely decorative, provide at least null alt text (alt=””).
3.Avoid text in images. If it is impossible, make sure that this text is repeated in alt text.

3.Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

The \<figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. While the content of the \<figure> element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.

4.Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

GIF is bitmap format supports up to 8 bits per pixel which limits its color palette to 256. Not good for photographs an are mostly known these days for simply animated memes. GIFs are not huge players in the web design world.

SVG are vector graphics that support animation and their behaviors are defined in XML files for they can be searched, indexed, scripted and compressed. Vector graphics are great for logos and line art because they aren't made from pixels and can be infinitely resized without losing quality or increasing in size. SVGs are your best option when creating icons and line art for high-resolution displays.

5.What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

PNG: is the format perfect for screenshots and other types of imagery where there's not a lot of color data.

### Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1.Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

The foreground controls what color your brush or pencil will be, while the background color erases any added color and replaces it with the background color, which is white by default.

2.Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

I would add some color to the blog website.

3.What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

font-family:

4.What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

font-size property sets the size of the font. Changing the font size also updates the sizes of the font size-relative \<length> units, such as em, ex, and so forth.

font-weight property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font.

font-style property sets whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique
