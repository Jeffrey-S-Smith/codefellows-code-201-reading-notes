# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

  A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an \<a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

For \<a> and \<area> elements, the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

For \<base> elements, the href attribute specifies the base URL for all relative URLs on a page.

For \<link> elements, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource (most often a style sheet file).

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?



## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

    Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something is taken out of flow it works independently.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

    Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

    his is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top , left , bottom , and right to set the location.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

    position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.

## Learn JS

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

    Definition. Function declaration is a prototype that specifies the function name, return types and parameters without the function body. Function Definition, on the other hand, refers to the actual function that specifies the function name, return types and parameters with the function body.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.

### Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

    * Greater efficiency

    * Learning from fellow students
    * Social skills
    * Job interview readiness
    * Work environment readiness
