## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

  Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that was designed to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well for smaller layouts, such as components

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

Flexbox operates in a 2 axes system: a main and a cross axis. The main axis is your defining direction of how your flex items are placed in the flex container. Determining the cross axis is very simple, it's in the direction that's perpendicular to your main axis.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Disadvantages. While flexbox is supported by most major browsers, it's still newer than the traditional box model. This means older browsers don't support it as well (some not at all). There are also more inconsistencies across different browsers.
